        "sql": "SELECT team.teamName, COUNT(score.winningTeam_id) as numWins\nFROM team\nLEFT JOIN score ON team.team_id = score.winningTeam_id\nGROUP BY team.team_id\nORDER BY numWins DESC;",
        "queryRawResponse": "[('BYU', 3), ('UTAH', 1), ('OSU', 1), ('KANSAS', 1), ('TCU', 1), ('HOUSTON', 0)]",
        "friendlyResponse": "Here are the teams in the database ordered by the number of games they won, from most to least wins:\n1. BYU - 3 wins\n2. UTAH - 1 win\n3. OSU - 1 win\n4. KANSAS - 1 win\n5. TCU - 1 win\n6. HOUSTON - 0 wins",

        "friendlyResponse": "Sure! Here are the teams ordered by number of wins, from most to least: BYU (3), UTAH (1), OSU (1), KANSAS (1), TCU (1), HOUSTON (0).",
        "error": "None"

Analysis:
    Correctness: Both queries produced accurate results, correctly counting the number of wins for each team.
    Clarity: The friendly responses were clear and easy to understand, effectively communicating the results.
    Efficiency: The use of a LEFT JOIN ensures that all teams are listed, even those that haven't won any games.

Question that it tripped up on
question: Who was the leading scorer in the game between Houston and TCU?

GPT SQL Response:

    Zero_shot: 
    "question": "Who was the leading scorer in the game between Houston and TCU?",
        "sql": "SELECT leadingScorer\nFROM score\nJOIN game ON score.game_id = game.game_id\nJOIN team ON game.visitingTeam_id = team.team_id OR game.homeTeam_id = team.team_id\nWHERE team.teamName = 'Houston' OR team.teamName = 'TCU';",
        "queryRawResponse": "[('12',), ('7',)]",
        "friendlyResponse": "The leading scorer in the game between Houston and TCU was player number 12.",
        "error": "None"

    Single_domain_double_shot:
    "question": "Who was the leading scorer in the game between Houston and TCU?",
        "sql": "SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name\nFROM player p\nJOIN score s ON p.player_id = s.leadingScorer\nJOIN game g ON s.game_id = g.game_id\nJOIN team t ON g.visitingTeam_id = t.team_id\nJOIN team t2 ON g.homeTeam_id = t2.team_id\nWHERE (t.teamName = 'Houston' AND t2.teamName = 'TCU');",
        "queryRawResponse": "[]",
        "friendlyResponse": "The leading scorer in the game between Houston and TCU was [Name of Leading Scorer].",
        "error": "None"

Analysis:
    Zero-shot Performance: The first query returned two player IDs but failed to identify them as leading scorers due to missing join with the player table, leading to unclear results about the player's identity. Instead of providing player names, it merely presented the ID numbers, which can be ambiguous.
    Single-domain double-shot Performance: The second query returned no results ([]), which indicates either an issue with the game IDs or player associations within the tables.
    Efficiency: While the query design was generally appropriate, it seems that the logic to filter players based on team affiliation wasn't executed correctly in this context. The issue could stem from an incorrect association or missing data.


Conclusion: 
    Successes:
        The query for listing teams by wins was successfully formulated and executed, demonstrating the capability of the system to interpret complex queries and return accurate results.
        The responses provided were user-friendly and clearly communicated the information needed.
    
    Challenges:
        The leading scorer query encountered issues in correctly identifying players, highlighting a potential gap in data association or join conditions.
        The failure to return names in the zero-shot response indicates a need for improved handling of related tables to ensure that meaningful data is extracted.
